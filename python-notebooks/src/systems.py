# ## Specification
# 
# **TODO:**
# - Encode this specification and the requirements of simulations as abstract base classes?
# - Consider changing to [`numba.typed.Dict`](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/pysupported.html#typed-dict) in the future if the API is guaranteed to be stable.
# 
# A system for simulation is a [Numba `jitclass`](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/jitclass.html) that implements `state`, `state_names`, and `copy` functions. Given an instance `s` of a system class `System`, these function should satisfy
# ```python
# id_systems = [
#     s,
#     s.copy(), # deep
#     System(*s.state()),
#     System(**{k: v for k, v in zip(s.state_names(), s.state())})
# ]
# 1 == len({t.state() for t in id_systems}) == len({t.state_names() for t in id_systems})
# ```
# By default, we have
# ```python
# class System: # ...
#     def copy(self):
#         return self.__class__(*self.state())
# ```
# In addition, different simulations may require more methods to be implemented.
# ### Wang-Landau
# A Wang-Landau simulation requires a `System` to have the variables `E` and `EÎ½` and to implement the methods `energy_bins`, `energy`, `propose`, and `accept`.
