# REU poster creation notes

I first started making the poster as a `beamerposter` with TikZ (see
`tikz-poster`), but then decided to make the final arrangement with Inkscape. To
make the description of the setup more understandable, I also animated the
center diagram as its own set of slides (`setup-diagram`), and combined this
with the main poster pieces (`components`) to make the final poster
`poster-slides.pdf`.
