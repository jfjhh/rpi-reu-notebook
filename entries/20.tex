  Natural images
}

We consider some of the statistics mentioned in Ruderman's statistics of natural
images, and investigate his suggestion that natural images may be able to be
reconstructed by somehow inverting the reduction of an image to variances of
image blocks.\footnote{\textsc{Doi}:

We later consider heuristic approaches using fractal noise, which we construct
from combining Perlin noise at different scales. This is standard practice for
procedurally generating terrain in computer graphics. From the perspective of
Kolmogorov complexity, the methods used in computer graphics and video games may
be taken as upper bounds for optimal programs that generate natural images.
