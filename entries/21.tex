This week, I continued the literature search and have started to implement an
algorithm for constructing images with the variance statistics of natural images
by inverting a neighborhood operation. Since the computational complexity of one
step is $O(mn^3)$, where $m$ is the number of pixels in a block and $n$ is the
number of pixels in the starting reduced image, we are limited to images with
only hundreds of pixels per side. I have also considered some Perlin noise based
techniques for generating fractal noise and then natural images.
