  Project description
}

The aim of this \textsc{reu} project is to quantify the information present in
images by the principled application of methods from statistical physics. The
approach is to find a suitable notion of entropy which captures the salient
features of particular kinds of images. We will consider a variety of features
motivated by intuition or domain knowledge, and then move to machine learning as
a tool for discovering other features.
